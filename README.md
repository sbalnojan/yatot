# yatot - Yet-Another-Transformation-Only-Tool
[Dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core) is an amazing tool, the very first "transformation-only-tool", the tool basically founded the analytics engineering direction. And yet I am still amazed that is the only player in a space that so desperately needs more tools in it! After all, there are a gazillion data integration tools which all basically do the same.

So, what is _yatot_? And where is _yatot_?
## Yatot 
Yatot takes the strengths of Dbt, which are a clear focus on combining SQL & software engineering best practices like modularity and advances them in a way that makes data developers even more productive. 

In particular, yatot adds:
- Tests written in Python, because it is simply so much more efficient than SQL based tests.
- Unit testing of CTEs, because they are the true "units" of the analytics engineer.
- advanced sample data extraction & faking to make local development reaaaally fast, even without connecting to a database.


## Where is yatot?
Ah, I don't know. Can you tell me? If you're a better developer than me, maybe you should just go on and create it :-D
